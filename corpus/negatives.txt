I am feeling very sad today.
This is the worst day ever.
Nothing seems to go right.
I am disappointed in you.
What a terrible surprise!
Life feels so hard.
I feel awful today.
You make me upset.
Everything is going wrong.
Failure seems inevitable.
I feel bad
I can't stand this anymore.
Why does everything have to be so difficult?
I'm always making mistakes.
Nothing ever works out for me.
I feel so alone.
Today is just another disappointment.
I'm tired of failing.
No one understands me.
I wish things were different.
I'm losing hope.
I can't take this anymore.
Everything is falling apart.
Why does nothing ever go my way?
I'm so frustrated with my life.
I feel completely hopeless.
Nothing makes me happy these days.
I'm overwhelmed by negativity.
Every day feels like a struggle.
I just want to give up.
No matter what I do, I fail.
I feel like I'm stuck in a rut.
Everything I try ends in disappointment.
I'm so exhausted by all of this.
Why can't I ever catch a break?
It feels like nobody cares.
I'm drowning in my own thoughts.
Nothing excites me anymore.
I'm constantly worried about failing.
I feel invisible to everyone around me.
Every little thing bothers me these days.
I can't find any motivation.
It seems like happiness is out of reach.
I'm always anxious about the future.
I feel like giving up on everything.
No matter how hard I try, it's never enough.
I broke my leg
